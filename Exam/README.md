# Stochastic Simulation Project

This project is a stochastic simulation of various systems, including a COVID-19 model, a circadian rhythm model, and several example models. The simulations are implemented in C++ and the results are visualized using Python.

### Prerequisites

- G++ or another C++ compiler
- Python 3.x
- pandas library for Python
- matplotlib library for Python

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the C++ files using your preferred C++ compiler.
4. Run the compiled executable to generate the simulation data.
5. Run the Python scripts to visualize the simulation data.

## Running the Simulations

The main entry point for the simulations is `main.cpp`. This file contains several functions that set up and run the simulations. The results of the simulations are saved to CSV files.

To run a simulation, uncomment the corresponding function call in the `main` function and run the compiled executable.

## Visualizing the Results

The `graphical_simulation.py` script in the `CsvFiles` directory is used to visualize the results of the simulations. This script reads the CSV files generated by the simulations and plots the data.

To visualize the results of a simulation, run the `graphical_simulation.py` script after running the corresponding simulation.
